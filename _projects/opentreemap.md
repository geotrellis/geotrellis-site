intro: OpenTreeMap allows urban foresters to map trees from a phone or tablet, calculate ecosystem benefits, and more.
body: Different communities have different tree planting needs. This tree prioritization demo enables users to combine multiple datasets and set weights to generate a list of priority tree planting sites. Datasets include household income, percent tree canopy cover, and impervious surface among others.
